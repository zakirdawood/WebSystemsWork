                <h2 class="article-title">The Story So Far</h2>
                <article id="article-main">On September 29th, 2002 at Scarborough General Hospital, a new baby (who had little idea
                    what life had in store for him) was born. He would go on to study hard at school while making
                    new friends everywhere he goes. That boy grew up falling in love with technology and everything 
                    it had to offer. He became curious about how all this stuff came to be. That's when he fell in
                    love with coding. He found out that so many of the things around him had code behind it. That's
                    when he started to learn how to create games and programs. He started off with visual basic,
                    before learning python. He decided to major in computer science and quickly began learning his
                    trade. Soon, he grew interest in creating websites. He ended up enrolling in CPS530. The lab 2 
                    assignment required him to create a website using 'vanilla' html and css. Thus, that brings him here. A 
                    website designed by Zakir Dawood. <strong>The person whose story this is about.</strong>
