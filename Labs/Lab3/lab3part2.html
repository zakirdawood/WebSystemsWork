                Bo and Sunny are perhaps the most well-known pair of dogs in the world. Bo was initially adopted as a gift from the former president to his daughters Sasha and Malia. He promised them 
                before the election that he would let them adopt a dog whether he won or lost the election. Thankfully for Barack Obama, he was on the winning side of that election. Bo must have really 
                brightened up the whitehouse as a few years later, in 2013, the Obamas adopted Sunny. The pair collectively became two of America's most adored pets. While Bo is currently not with us, 
                Sunny continues to live on his legacy and charm millions of us around the world.
