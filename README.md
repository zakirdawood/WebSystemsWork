# CPS530
This repository showcases the work I've done in CPS530, a course at Ryerson University called Web Systems Development. This course started with the very basics of HTML and CSS before quickly moving to frameworks, backend languages like Python, PHP, Perl, CGI, ASP and Ruby, and processing XML and JSON files.
