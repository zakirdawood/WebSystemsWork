# Web Systems Work
This repository showcases the work I've done in Web Systems Development, a course at Ryerson University. This course started with the very basics of HTML and CSS before quickly moving to frameworks, backend languages like Python, PHP, Perl, CGI, ASP and Ruby, and processing XML and JSON files.
